          After the attack on U.S. naval base Pearl Harbor, several 
          Japanese Americans experienced hatred and racism. In order 
          to determine which Asian Americans were our allies, Life Magazine 
          decided to release "How to tell the Japs from the Chinese". In the magazine, 
          it displays one Chinese American man on top and a Japanese man at the bottom, 
          both of which have writing detailing their facial features. The magazine states 
          that a Chinese American they would have a scant beard, longer and narrower face,
          a parchment yellow complexion, lighter facial bones, a higher nose bridge, and 
          a more frequent epicanthic fold. On the contrary, a Japanese American would have
          massive cheek and jawbone structure, heavy beard, broader and shorter face, flatter nose, earthy 
          yellow complexion, less frequent epicanthic fold, and sometimes nosy cheeks.

        Although there was already a magazine establishing the different 
        facial features between Chinese American men and Japanese American men, 
        Times Magazine decided to release one of their own, titiled "How to Tell 
        Your Friends from Japs" to futher help the American people. In the magazine 
        it displays two Chinese Americans at the top and bottom left, and two Japanese men 
        at the top and bottom right. Instead of only listing faccial features, Times Magazine
        decided to also list the physical and speech differences. A Chinse American would be 
        tall, put on weight, not as broaded shoulder, not as hairy, avoid horn-rimmed 
        spectacles, placid and kind people, and have an easy gait. A Japanese man would be 
        short, not put on weight, are fat, grow an impressive mustache, narrow faces 
        that make them look like caucasians, eyes are usually set closer together, 
        arrogant and dogmatic, are hesitant nervous in conversation, and always stiff 
        in conversation.
